# py_tictactoe
A simple tictactoe game created using python and pygame. This game follows the same rules as the classic tic tac toe game

1) The 9 squares on the board are all clickable, and when a user clicks on a square either a X or O will appear
2) There is text in the bottom of the board that says whether it is X or O turn
3) If there is a winner of a draw the board will be cleared
4) There is a tracker in the bottom of the board recording how many times X or O has won
